# Discraft
Discraft is a Minecraft mod for LiteLoader, which adds Discord rich presence to
Minecraft.

## Screenshots
🚧 Under construction 🚧

## Installation
1. Get LiteLoader 1.12.2 [here](http://www.liteloader.com/download#snapshot_11220)
2. Create a new profile with LiteLoader, start it once, close the game
and open its directory
3. Download **Discraft** [here]()
4. Drop **Discraft** into your `mods/`-Directory
5. PROFIT!!!

## Settings
You can edit the state messages shown in Discord in the "Settings"-menu in
the LiteLoader window

## Why?
There are a lot of Discord rich presence mods for Forge, Fabric, etc. \
However, Fabric is 1.14.x+ and Forge has to much overhead for just one mod. \
This mod is for those people, who still play vanila 1.12.2 (like me 😁)
